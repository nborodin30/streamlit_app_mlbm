# ML for Biomedicine Demo Application

This repository contains an interactive **Streamlit** application demonstrating machine learning applications in biomedicine.  
The application integrates **genomic data analysis** (exon detection) and **natural language processing** (disease prediction from symptoms).

---

## üìå Overview
The app provides an educational demonstration of end-to-end ML pipelines in biomedical contexts.  
It consists of four main modules:

1. **Home Page** ‚Äì Application overview and demo video.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** ‚Äì Genomic sequence statistics with visualization.  
3. **Genomics Exon Detection** ‚Äì CNN-based exon/intron classification.  
4. **Natural Language Processing** ‚Äì Disease prediction from symptom descriptions.  

The backend includes a complete training pipeline for the genomic CNN model, implemented with **Hydra** for configuration management.

## ‚ú® Features

### Genomic Exploratory Data Analysis
- Upload FASTA files containing nucleotide sequences and binary masks (0 = intron, 1 = exon).
- Compute class distributions and chromosome-level statistics.
- Visualize sequence length distributions and exon ratios per chromosome.
- Validate alignment between sequence and mask IDs.

### Exon/Intron Classification
- Pre-trained **1D CNN** model for predicting exon probability of center nucleotides (127-bp windows).  
- Supports:
  - **Batch FASTA processing**.
  - **Manual sequence input**.  
- One-hot encoding of nucleotides (A, C, G, T, N).  
- Export results as CSV.  
- Interactive histograms of predictions via **Plotly**.

### NLP Pipeline for Symptom-Based Disease Prediction
- Upload CSV datasets (symptoms + disease labels).  
- Dynamic column selection for text and labels.  
- Multiple text representations: **TF-IDF** or **Sentence Transformer embeddings**.  
- 5 classifiers with cross-validation: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN.  
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)**.  
- Word frequency analysis, histograms, word clouds.  
- Export trained models (pickle, joblib, numpy).
